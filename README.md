## What it is

**Secrets Dispatcher** is a per-operation approval gate and audit log for the **Linux keyring and git commit signing** — a drop-in [Secret Service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/) proxy that sits in front of the keyring you already have (gnome-keyring, [gopass-secret-service](https://github.com/nikicat/gopass-secret-service), KeePassXC…). Same secrets, same data, and **[reversible in one command](#setup)**.

![secrets-dispatcher sits between the apps that request secrets — browser, AI agents, CLI tools, git commit -S — and your keyring / GPG signing key, adding per-request approval, full process-chain detection, trust rules, and an audit log](docs/diagram/architecture.png)

## What it does

When something reads a secret, you see *what* it touched and the full process chain (`claude-code → node → secret-tool`), and you approve, deny, or auto-allow — the tools you trust fade into rules, everything else has to ask. Every access is logged, including the deciding rule when policy resolves it, and the same gate covers what gets committed and signed as you (`git commit -S`).

## Why it's needed

**Your AI coding agent runs as you — so it can read every secret in your keyring, silently.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, any script you launch call the Linux Secret Service and read any unlocked credential with no prompt and no log. Usually it isn't malice — just an agent taking a wrong path to a task — but you never see it happen. Underneath that:

- **The keyring has no per-app access control.** Once it's unlocked, any process running as you can read any secret over the Secret Service D-Bus API — no prompt, no audit trail, no way to know which process accessed what.
- **`git commit -S` signs blindly.** GPG signs whatever it's handed, with no human-visible context — so an agent or CI step can produce a commit signed by *you* with content you never reviewed.

> **Honest scope.** This is visibility and control — *not* a sandbox or a privilege
> boundary. It runs as your user, and it gates the **keyring** and **GPG signing**, not
> `.env` files or arbitrary disk reads. A smoke detector, not a vault door: pair it with a
> sandbox if you need to *contain* an agent; use this to *see and decide* when the agents,
> apps, and scripts you run natively touch your secrets or signing key. [More on the security
> model →](SECURITY.md)

> **Applies to:** **Linux desktops** with a Secret Service keyring on the session bus.
> The reversible one-command setup is verified on **GNOME** (gnome-keyring) and
> **[gopass-secret-service](https://github.com/nikicat/gopass-secret-service)**; KDE/KWallet,
> KeePassXC, and other desktops aren't verified yet and may need manual setup. **Not macOS
> or Windows** — those use different keyring APIs (gopass the CLI runs there, but the
> Secret Service this gates does not). [Details →](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md)

## Setup

You need Linux with a running Secret Service keyring and/or GPG for signing — the commands auto-detect your provider (see [Applies to](#) above for which desktops are verified). First, get the binary:

```bash
# Prebuilt static binary (amd64; arm64 also on the releases page)
curl -Lo ~/.local/bin/secrets-dispatcher \
  https://github.com/nikicat/secrets-dispatcher/releases/latest/download/secrets-dispatcher-linux-amd64
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/secrets-dispatcher
```

<details>
<summary>Other install methods — <code>go install</code>, from source</summary>

```bash
# With Go (web UI included — the compiled frontend is committed)
go install github.com/nikicat/secrets-dispatcher@latest

# From source (needs Go + npm for the embedded web UI)
git clone https://github.com/nikicat/secrets-dispatcher.git
cd secrets-dispatcher && make build && make install   # → ~/.local/bin
```

</details>

### Temporary — try it, fully reversible

One command puts the dispatcher in front of your keyring (same data, demoted to a private backend) and prints a web UI address. **Ctrl-C restores everything exactly** — your config is never touched.

```bash
secrets-dispatcher try
# then, in another terminal, make something ask for a secret:
secret-tool store --label=demo service demo
secret-tool lookup service demo        # → an approval prompt appears
```

`secrets-dispatcher try --dry-run` shows the exact file/unit changes first, and `secrets-dispatcher service status` confirms the takeover state any time.

### Permanent — run it as a service

Install the systemd user service and put the dispatcher in front of your keyring on every login. `service uninstall` restores stock behavior exactly.

```bash
secrets-dispatcher service install   # installs, starts, and takes over your keyring
secrets-dispatcher service status    # confirm it's in front of your keyring
```

Now every secret access — and every signed commit — goes through approval, via a desktop notification, the CLI (`secrets-dispatcher list`), or the web UI (`secrets-dispatcher login`).

<summary>Screencasts — install &amp; uninstall</summary>

**Install** (permanent, across a re-login):

[![secrets-dispatcher service install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikicat/secrets-dispatcher-ci-media/main/latest/install-noble.webp)](https://nikicat.github.io/secrets-dispatcher-ci-media/latest/install-noble.mp4)

**Uninstall** (back to stock):

[![secrets-dispatcher service uninstall](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikicat/secrets-dispatcher-ci-media/main/latest/uninstall-noble.webp)](https://nikicat.github.io/secrets-dispatcher-ci-media/latest/uninstall-noble.mp4)

</details>

### Gate git commit signing

Route git's signing through the dispatcher, then **turn signing on globally** — that's what makes *every* commit (including the ones your agents make without `-S`) pause for your review before the key is used:

```bash
secrets-dispatcher gpg-sign setup           # point git's gpg.program at the dispatcher
git config --global commit.gpgsign true      # sign — and therefore gate — every commit
```

Now any `git commit` shows you the repo, message, and changed files and waits for approve/deny before GPG signs. Without global signing, only an explicit `git commit -S` is gated — an agent that just runs `git commit` slips through.

<!-- TODO: record a commit-signing screencast (the trial/install/uninstall ones exist in the ci-media sidecar; signing doesn't yet). -->

## Approving requests

When a request isn't already covered by a rule, you see the full picture — what's asking (the whole process chain), for which secret — and decide:

![secrets-dispatcher web UI: a pending secret-access request showing the full process chain, with Approve and Deny buttons](docs/screenshots/webui-overview.png)

- **Web UI** — real-time dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8484` (`secrets-dispatcher login`)
- **Desktop notifications** — inline Approve / Deny buttons
- **CLI** — `secrets-dispatcher list` · `approve <id>` · `deny <id>`

All three stay in sync in real time.

## Keep secrets out of `.env`

The most common way an agent grabs a credential is reading a plaintext `.env` off
disk — which no keyring gate can see. The fix is to not keep the secret in the file
at all: fetch it from the keyring at runtime with [direnv](https://direnv.net/), so
the value only ever lives in the shell's memory (never on disk) and every fetch goes
through secrets-dispatcher:

```bash
# .envrc — the secret is fetched from the keyring, never written to the file
export API_KEY=$(secret-tool lookup url https://alchemy.com xdg:schema io.github.nikicat.ApiKey)
export SCAN_API_KEY=$(gopass-secret get api-key etherscan.io)   # with gopass-secret-service
```

Now entering the project fetches the secret through the Secret Service — so the first
lookup prompts for approval and every lookup is logged, instead of a plaintext secret
sitting on disk for anything to read. Auto-approve the tools you trust so it stays
quiet. (Once exported, the value is a normal env var in that shell — this removes the
on-disk copy and gates/audits the fetch; it isn't a boundary against a process already
running in the same shell.)

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/secrets-dispatcher/config.yaml`:

```yaml
listen: "127.0.0.1:8484"           # web UI address
serve:
  timeout: 5m                      # approval request timeout
  approval_window: 2s              # batch concurrent requests into one prompt
  notifications: true              # desktop notifications
  ignore_chrome_dummy_secret: true # suppress Chrome's probe
  rules: []                        # trust rules — see docs/TRUST-RULES.md
  trusted_signers: []              # auto-approve GPG signing from these tools
```

**Trust rules** auto-approve known-safe patterns so the dispatcher stays quiet. The easiest way to add or adjust one is the bundled **`secrets-rule` agent skill**: with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), hand it a request ID from `secrets-dispatcher list` — `/secrets-rule b260def` — and it reads that request's full context (process chain, `exe`, attributes) to compose an accurate rule; or just say *"always allow Firefox"*. Either way it picks a spoof-proof `exe` match, writes the rule, and offers to restart. See **[docs/TRUST-RULES.md](docs/TRUST-RULES.md)** for the format and how to install the skill.
